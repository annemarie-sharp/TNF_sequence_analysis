# Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) Gene

## Objective
To analyze and interpret the human TNF gene sequence, which encodes a proinflammatory cytokine called TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor).

## Project Workflow
1. Download the human TNF gene sequence.
2. Translate the sequence into amino acids.
3. Identify open reading frames (ORFs) within the sequence.
4. Analyze the sequence composition.
5. Identify transcription factor binding sites (TFBS).
6. Search for functional motifs within the sequence.
7. Predict the coding and non-coding regions within the sequence.
8. Convert the sequence from FASTA to PHYLIP format for further analysis.

## Tools
The following bioinformatics tools and resources were utilized:

- **NCBI**: To download the TNF gene sequence  
- **BioEdit**: To view, edit, and analyze the sequence  
- **TFBSPred**: To identify/predict transcription factor binding sites within the sequence  
- **MEME Suite**: To identify functional motifs in the sequence  
- **GENSCAN**: To predict the coding and non-coding regions within the sequence
